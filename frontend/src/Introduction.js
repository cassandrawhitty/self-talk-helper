            <h4>This is a tool to help people take ownership over their mental health.  
                It uses the teachings of David D. Burns, a psychiatrist and author of "Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy."  
                Many of our thoughts contain various cognitive distortions, and these thoughts often cause us suffering. To put things in perspective,
                we can become aware of our thoughts and which distortions show up most often for us.  By writing the thought down
                and becoming aware of the cognitive distortions present, we are empowered to rewrite the thought in a way that grounds us, becuase it is more truthful.  
                This practice of writing an unrealistic thought, idenitifying cognitive distortions, and rewriting the thought
                in a more reasonable way can help retrain our minds.  This self-talk helper is here to help as a therapeutic tool, but it is not to be used as a replacement for care from a licensed professional. </h4>
                <h2><b>Cognitive Distortions with Descriptions: </b></h2>
                <p><b>All or Nothing Thinking: </b> You look at things in absolute, black and white categories.</p>
                <p><b>Overgeneralization: </b> You view a negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.</p>
                <p><b>Mental Filter: </b> You dwell on the negatives and ignore the positives.</p>
                <p><b>Discounting the Positives: </b> You insist that your accomplishments or positive qualities "don't count."</p>
                <p><b>Jumping to Conclusions - Mind Reading: </b> You assume that people are reacting negatively to you when there's no definite evidence for this.</p>
                <p><b>Jumping to Conclusions - Future Telling: </b> You arbitrarily predict things will turn out badly.</p>
                <p><b>Magnification/Minimization: </b> You blow things way out of proportion or you shrink their importance inappropriately.</p>
                <p><b>Emotional Reasoning: </b> You reason from how you feel.  "I feel like an idiot, so I reallly must be one."  Or "I don't feel like doing this, so I'll put it off."</p>
                <p><b>"Should" Statements: </b> You criticize yourself or other people with "shoulds" or "shouldn'ts." "Musts," "Oughts," "Have tos" are similar offenders.</p>
                <p><b>Labeling: </b> You identify with your shortcomings.  Instead of Saying, "I made a mistake," you tell yourself, "I'm a jerk," or "a fool," or "a loser."</p>
                <p><b>Personalization and Blame: </b> You blame yourself for something you weren't entirely responsible for, or you blame other people and overlook ways that your own attitudes and behavior might contribute to a problem.</p>
